## Building 'good enough' digital workflows in the field

Like many scientific disciplines, environmental science relies on increasingly large and complex datasets, the analysis of which require a combination of domain expertise and specialist computational skills. However, unlike many other disciplines, much environmental science data collection and analysis takes place in remote locations, without access to the internet, HPC systems, or tech support. This talk will detail the challenges of collecting, managing and processing large volumes of environmental data over several months of fieldwork in Spanish, Polish and Finnish forests. Over the course of several years, we have collected high resolution 3D point cloud data of forest structure from ground-based and airborne laser scanners, alongside aerial photography and ecological measurements. Through this process we have confronted issues of reproducibility, offline data management, instrument failure and conflicting proprietary workflows. We contrast these approaches with ideas of 'best practice' and identify a series of lessons that can be applied to future data-intensive fieldwork, in addition to providing valuable perspective for non-field based research.
